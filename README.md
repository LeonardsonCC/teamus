# teamus
Dead simple terminal music player written in go

## Installation
For now, you have to have the golang binary installed. Just clone this repository, and type `go run .`. Or maybe you can build the repository using `go build`. Also you can 
test this repo by using the command `go run github.com/aretrosen/teamus@latest`.\
**NOTE:** This was made in a Linux environment, with a Music directory. There are plans to add directories via json/yaml file later, but for now you **need** to have the `$HOME/Music` directory.
